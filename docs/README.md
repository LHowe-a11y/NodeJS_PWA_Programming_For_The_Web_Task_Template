# Australian Public Holidays 2025 PWA Architecture

## Submission for PWA task

I am unsure how well this will run on **Windows computers**, it runs on **MacOS** and will *probably* run on most Linux machines. This is also the code and architecture for a PWA, not the Progressive Web Application itself, as this codebase is not permanently hosted on any webserver so to test it you must run the built-in Node.js webserver and access the locally hosted website. 

To run the web server, run 'newindex.js' with elevated permissions (if it breaks try manually installing the nessecary node modules under dependencies in 'package.json'). For bash (including zsh and probably gitbash) try 'sudo node newindex.js' while in the root folder.
