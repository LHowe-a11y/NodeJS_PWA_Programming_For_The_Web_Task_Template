                <div>
                    <h3>Jurisdiction</h3>
                    <p>This is first from the left.
                        Click this button to show/hide a dropdown menu with a button for each state/territory on it.
                        All are on by default. You may click a button to turn it off or back on again.
                        Search results will include holidays in the jurisdictions of the states and territories that are switched on.
                        You must have at least one selected.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Earliest and latest dates</h3>
                    <p>The earliest date search bar is second from the left, the latest date one is third.
                        By default, they are blank. Input a date in YYYYMMDD form or leave blank for a valid search.
                        The search will return results on or after the earliest date, and on or before the latest date.
                        The default range (if left blank) is the first of January to the thirty-first of December, inclusive.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Name includes</h3>
                    <p>The 'name includes' search bar is fourth from the left, and blank by default.
                        Searches will return holidays with the input in this bar somewhere in the name.
                        You may leave this blank to include all names.
                        The input is not case sensitive.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sort</h3>
                    <p>The sort button is fifth from the left. Click it to show/hide a dropdown menu.
                        By default, nothing will be selected. Click a button in the menu to turn it on, or back off again.
                        You may leave nothing selected, but may only choose one sort option at a time. If you click a second button, it will turn on, but the other will turn off.
                        Searches will return the holidays sorted by the option selected. If left blank, this will be date ascending, grouped by state/territory.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Ascending/Descending switch</h3>
                    <p>The switch is sixth from the left, and says "Desc" to its left and "Asc" to its right.
                        This is short for descending and ascending, respectively. By default, the switch is set to descending.
                        Click the switch to change this to ascending or back to descending. This will determine the order the holidays are sorted in.
                        For example, sorting by date ascending will start with the lowest (first) date, and end with the highest (latest) date.
                        This might go from New Year's Day (Jan 1) to New Year's Eve (Dec 31). Sorting by date descending will reverse this.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Search button</h3>
                    <p>The search button is seventh from the left. Click it to show the results of your search.
                        The results shown will include your chosen filters and sorting.
                        Pressing the search button will also return these settings to default, but if you want to edit your search,
                        pressing the 'back' button in your browser will restore your chosen settings.
                    </p>
